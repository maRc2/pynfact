  * In `mulang.py`:
    * Retrieve metainfo without regenerating all HTML from Markdown

  * In *all* of the above and the rest:
    * Use a much more *pythonic* code.

Concerning templates:

  * `base.html.j2` should not have there those four Jinja2 lines since
    that's the file the user will be dealing with.
