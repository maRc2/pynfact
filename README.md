Why this name?
--------------

Granted it will be used on the "web", the word "log" in Latin may be
translated as *INdicem FACTorum*, hence *InFact* or **'nFact** to be
more easily pronounceable when prepending the prefix *py-*.

Also, *pyblog*, *pyblic*, *pyweblog* and many other cool names were
taken either in GitHub or Google Code.


First notes
-----------

This project is in development, so there are some features that are
not working yet, such as the *Disqus* capability. Other than that, the
only thing it lacks is to deploy it as a package.

For usage, configuration and more information read the [GitHub Wiki
section](https://github.com/alberteromero/pynfact/wiki) associated to
this project.
